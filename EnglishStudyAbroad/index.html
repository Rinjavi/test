                  <p>We are only here to help you have an amazing experience in England. 
                    We don’t force things you don’t appreciate or feel like doing. </p>
                  <h5>生徒がこの期間でしたいことを重視するプラン計画</h5>
                  <p>We will listen to what you want from this study abroad and we will organize the plans for you 
                    and display the approximate expenses throughout the time you are going to be there. 
                    Even if we don’t know what you want, and only have a vague idea of going abroad, 
                    feel free to contact us because that’s what we are here for.</p>
                  <h5>支払える金額の設定から、見積もるあなたにあったプラン計画</h5>
                  <p>We really appreciate the fact that you are considering going abroad 
                    because we know it needs a lot of courage to even talk about it with anyone. 
                    Not only that, everything is getting way more expensive than it used to be nowadays 
                    and the parents don't encourage you to even consider about going abroad.
                    So we are also here to help you convince your parents if needed. 
                    We can come up with the reasonable expense level where the parents can 
                    consider so that you can fulfill your goal. 
                  </p>
                  <h5>有意義な留学にするための必要なアドバイス提供</h5>
                  <p>Now we know of lots of students that ended up regretting 
                    like “oh I wish I could do this or that” or “I regret not communicating more with the people around…” 
                    We don’t want you to regret it the same way 
                    so once we are done with organizing your expenses and plans, 
                    we will give you pieces of advice on what you should do 
                    and the things you can expect while you are there.</p>
